  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. 
    An algorithm with better Time complexity is considered more efficient because it performs faster on larger inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses while running. 
    It helps determine how much extra space is needed apart from the input data. 
    For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.
